### App Body
All components that needs to be call/compiled has been added here for simplicity and flexibility.
This body contains a main Div with a minimum-height greater than the inner Window height.

Upon reaching the bottom of the page, the controller of the component will add a new item to the list with respect to a service called `ItemsService`.
The list is nested in a child component called `items-list`.
